*I like that the article talks about the morality in having AI. Like, how it is used whether for surveillance, cyber attacks, or to help those who need it. I find it interesting that with the rise of AI, there is also the instant call to action for regulation, i.e. in South Korea and the EU. It reminds me of when guns were first introduced to the world, and how many people during that time were so fearful and aggressively against it. The same thing happened with nuclear weapons. That is actually where the post-apocalyptic and cold war-esque themes in media began to be popular. Now guns and nuclear war are less of a topic of fear. Although I belive AI can do both harm and good, I wonder when this fear of new technology will pass.*

*I also appreciate the broader perspective on how media and cultural themes evolve in response to technological advancements. It’s fascinating to consider how the fears associated with new technologies eventually diminish as they become more familiar and integrated into society. This observation makes me wonder about the future trajectory of AI—how long will it take until AI becomes as normalized as computers and smartphones, and what cultural shifts will accompany this acceptance?*

I definitely like how the article takes a nuetral stance around AI. It is definitely a powerful tool, but unless we have rules and proper giverning of that tool, it can quickly become a danger. I also like how the article gives reasons for why governance over AI is a good look on the company. -Tadelin De Leon

### Juno Cheung:
You’ve made a great point! Just like with guns and nuclear weapons, new technologies like AI spark fear because of their potential risks. People want regulation to manage these dangers, as seen in places like South Korea and the EU. Over time, though, societies often adapt and learn to balance the benefits and risks of new tech. With AI, its widespread use might mean the fear lingers longer, but eventually, we may see a shift where we’re more focused on its ethical use, just like we did with other technologies in the past. It’s about finding that balance
