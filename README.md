*I like that the article talks about the morality in having AI. Like, how it is used whether for surveillance, cyber attacks, or to help those who need it. I find it interesting that with the rise of AI, there is also the instant call to action for regulation, i.e. in South Korea and the EU. It reminds me of when guns were first introduced to the world, and how many people during that time were so fearful and aggressively against it. The same thing happened with nuclear weapons. That is actually where the post-apocalyptic and cold war-esque themes in media began to be popular. Now guns and nuclear war are less of a topic of fear. Although I belive AI can do both harm and good, I wonder when this fear of new technology will pass.*

*I also appreciate the broader perspective on how media and cultural themes evolve in response to technological advancements. It’s fascinating to consider how the fears associated with new technologies eventually diminish as they become more familiar and integrated into society. This observation makes me wonder about the future trajectory of AI—how long will it take until AI becomes as normalized as computers and smartphones, and what cultural shifts will accompany this acceptance?*
